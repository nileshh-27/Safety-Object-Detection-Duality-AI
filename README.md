# Duality AI's Space Station Challenge: Safety Object Detection

**Team Name:** [**Your Team Name Here**]

## 🚀 Project Overview

[cite_start]This project is a submission for the Duality AI's Space Station Challenge: Safety Object Detection #2[cite: 1]. [cite_start]The primary objective is to train a robust object detection model to accurately identify and classify 7 vital pieces of safety equipment within a simulated space station environment[cite: 4, 9]. [cite_start]The model was trained exclusively on a synthetic dataset generated by Duality AI's digital twin platform, Falcon[cite: 4, 223].

## 🏆 Final Performance

Our final model achieved an outstanding score that significantly surpasses the hackathon's baseline benchmark of 40-50%.

* **Final Score (mAP@0.5):** **72.6%**

## 🛠️ Model & Dataset

* **Model:** We used the **YOLOv8s** architecture from Ultralytics, starting with pre-trained weights.
* [cite_start]**Dataset:** The model was trained on the provided synthetic dataset featuring 7 object classes under various lighting conditions, occlusions, and camera angles[cite: 4, 29, 30, 31].
    * **Classes:** OxygenTank, NitrogenTank, FirstAidBox, FireAlarm, SafetySwitchPanel, EmergencyPhone, FireExtinguisher.

## ⚙️ How to Reproduce Results

Follow these steps to set up the environment and reproduce our final score. This guide assumes a Google Colab-like environment.

### 1. Setup & Installation

Clone the repository and organize the file structure as follows:

```
Duality_Hackathon/
├── dataset/
│   ├── train/
│   └── val/
├── scripts/
│   ├── train.py
│   ├── predict.py
│   ├── yolo_params.yaml
│   └── ... (other scripts)
└── README.md
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-contrib-python pyyaml
```

### 2. Run Prediction & Evaluation

To generate the final score and prediction files using our pre-trained model (`best.pt`), navigate to the `/scripts` directory and run the prediction script.

**Important:** The path to the `best.pt` model is hardcoded in `predict.py` to `../runs/train/exp2/weights/best.pt`. Please ensure the `runs` directory from our submission is in the correct location relative to the `scripts` folder.

```bash
# Navigate to the scripts directory
cd Duality_Hackathon/scripts/

# Run the prediction script
python predict.py
```

The script will print the final mAP score to the console and save prediction images in the `Duality_Hackathon/scripts/predictions/` folder.

### 3. (Optional) Re-Training the Model

To re-train the model from scratch, run the `train.py` script. The training process will automatically stop when the model's performance on the validation set stops improving.

```bash
# From the /scripts directory
python train.py --epochs 100 --batch 8 --mosaic 0.5 --optimizer AdamW --lr0 0.001
```

## ✨ (Bonus) Use Case Application

[**This is a placeholder for your bonus application. Briefly describe your app, what it does, and include a link to a video demonstration or the execution files.**]

For example:
"We developed a simple Python application that uses the trained model to monitor a live camera feed (or a pre-recorded video) of a simulated space station environment. The application draws bounding boxes around any detected safety equipment in real-time, providing an immediate visual inventory. A brief video demonstration can be found [here](link_to_your_video)."
